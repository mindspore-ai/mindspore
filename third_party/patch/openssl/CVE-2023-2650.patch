Subject: [PATCH] Restrict the size of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs that OBJ_obj2txt will
 translate

OBJ_obj2txt() would translate any size OBJECT IDENTIFIER to canonical
numeric text form.  For gigantic sub-identifiers, this would take a very
long time, the time complexity being O(n^2) where n is the size of that
sub-identifier.

To mitigate this, a restriction on the size that OBJ_obj2txt() will
translate to canonical numeric text form is added, based on RFC 2578
(STD 58), which says this:

> 3.5. OBJECT IDENTIFIER values
>
> An OBJECT IDENTIFIER value is an ordered list of non-negative numbers.
> For the SMIv2, each number in the list is referred to as a sub-identifier,
> there are at most 128 sub-identifiers in a value, and each sub-identifier
> has a maximum value of 2^32-1 (4294967295 decimal).

Fixes otc/security#96
Fixes CVE-2023-2650
