zeros_like:
    description: |
        Returns a Tensor with a value of 0 and its shape and data type is the same as the input.

            Args:
                - **input_x** (Tensor) - Input Tensor of any dimension.

            Returns:
                Tensor, has the same shape and data type as `input_x` but filled with zeros.

            Raises:
                TypeError: If `input_x` is not a Tensor.

            Supported Platforms:
                ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

            Examples:
                >>> import numpy as np
                >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
                >>> input_x = Tensor(np.array([[0, 1], [2, 1]]).astype(np.float32))
                >>> output = ops.zeros_like_(input_x)
                >>> print(output)
                [[0. 0.]
                 [0. 0.]]
