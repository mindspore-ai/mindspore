reduce_mean:
  description: |
    Reduces a dimension of a tensor by averaging all elements in the dimension, by default. And also can reduce
      a dimension of `x` along the axis. Determine whether the dimensions of the output and input are the same by
        controlling `keep_dims`.
    
        Args:
            x (Tensor[Number]): The input tensor.
            axis (Union[int, tuple(int), list(int)]): The dimensions to reduce. Default: ``()`` , reduce all
                dimensions. Must be in the range [-r, r).
            keep_dims (bool): If ``True`` , keep these reduced dimensions and the length is 1.
                If ``False`` , don't keep these dimensions. Default: ``False`` .
    
        Returns:
            output(Tensor): with the same dtype as the `x`.
    
            - If `axis` is (), and `keep_dims` is ``False`` ,
              the output is a 0-D tensor representing the mean of all elements in the input tensor.
            - If `axis` is int, set as 1, and `keep_dims` is ``False`` ,
              the shape of output is :math:`(x_0, x_2, ..., x_R)`.
            - If `axis` is tuple(int) or list(int), set as (1, 2), and `keep_dims` is ``False`` ,
              the shape of output is :math:`(x_0, x_3, ..., x_R)`.
    
        Raises:
            TypeError: If `keep_dims` is not a bool.
            TypeError: If `x` is not a Tensor.
            TypeError: If `axis` is not one of the following: int, tuple or list.
            ValueError: If `axis` is out of range.
