reduce_any:
  description: |
    Reduces a dimension of a tensor by the "logical OR" of all elements in the dimension, by default. And also can
        reduce a dimension of `x` along the axis. Determine whether the dimensions of the output and input are the same by
        controlling `keep_dims`.
    
        Args:
            x (Tensor[bool]): The dtype of the tensor to be reduced is bool.
            axis (Union[int, tuple(int), list(int)]): The dimensions to reduce. Default: ``()`` , reduce all
                dimensions. Must be in the range [-rank(x), rank(x)).
            keep_dims (bool): If ``True`` , keep these reduced dimensions and the length is 1.
                If ``False`` , don't keep these dimensions. Default: ``False`` .
    
        Returns:
            output(Tensor): the dtype is bool.
    
            - If axis is (), and keep_dims is False,
              the output is a 0-D tensor representing the "logical or" of all elements in the input tensor.
            - If axis is int, set as 2, and keep_dims is False,
              the shape of output is :math:`(x_1, x_3, ..., x_R)`.
            - If axis is tuple(int), set as (2, 3), and keep_dims is False,
              the shape of output is :math:`(x_1, x_4, ..., x_R)`.
    
        Raises:
            TypeError: If `keep_dims` is not a bool.
            TypeError: If `x` is not a Tensor.
            TypeError: If `axis` is not one of the following: int, tuple or list.
            ValueError: If `axis` is out of range.

        Examples:
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> x = Tensor(np.array([[True, False], [True, True]]))
            >>> # case 1: Reduces a dimension by the "logical OR" of all elements in the dimension.
            >>> output = ops.reduce_any(x, (), keep_dims=True)
            >>> print(output)
            [[ True]]
            >>> print(output.shape)
            (1, 1)
            >>> # case 2: Reduces a dimension along axis 0.
            >>> output = ops.reduce_any(x, 0, keep_dims=True)
            >>> print(output)
            [[ True True]]
            >>> # case 3: Reduces a dimension along axis 1.
            >>> output = ops.reduce_any(x, 1, keep_dims=True)
            >>> print(output)
            [[True]
            [ True]]
            >>> # case 4: input is a scalar.
            >>> x = Tensor(True)
            >>> output = ops.reduce_any(x)
            >>> print(output)
            True
