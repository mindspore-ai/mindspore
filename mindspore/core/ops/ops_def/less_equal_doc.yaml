less_equal:
  description: |
    Computes the boolean value of :math:`x <= y` element-wise.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.le` for more details.

        Inputs:
            - **x** (Union[Tensor, number.Number, bool]) - The first input is a number.Number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is
            `number <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore.html#mindspore.dtype>`_ or
            `bool_ <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore.html#mindspore.dtype>`_.
            - **y** (Union[Tensor, number.Number, bool]) - The second input, when the first input is a Tensor,
            the second input should be a number.Number or bool value, or a Tensor whose data type is number or bool\_.
            When the first input is Scalar, the second input must be a Tensor whose data type is number or bool\_.

        Outputs:
            Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting, and the data type is bool.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1, 2, 3]), mindspore.int32)
            >>> y = Tensor(np.array([1, 1, 4]), mindspore.int32)
            >>> output = ops.less_equal(x, y)
            >>> print(output)
            [ True False  True]
