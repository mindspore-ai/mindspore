masked_fill:
    description: |
        Fills elements of Tensor with value where mask is True.
            The shapes of `input` and `mask` need to be the same or broadcastable.

            Note:
                If `value` is a floating-point number of Python, it will be converted to float32 later by default.
                In this case, if `input` is a float16 Tensor, it will be converted to float32 for calculation,
                and the result type will be converted back to float16 on the CPU and Ascend platforms, which may
                cause the performance penalty. A TypeError may be raised on the GPU platform. Therefore,
                it is recommended that 'value' should use a Tensor with the same dtype as `input`.

            Args:
                - **input** (Tensor): The source Tensor whose data type is one of bool, uint8, int8, int16, int32,
                            int64, float16, float32, float64, complex64, complex128.
                - **mask** (Tensor[bool]): The boolean mask.
                - **value** (Union[number, Tensor]): The value to fill in with, which dtype is the same as `input`.

            Returns:
                Tensor, has the same type and shape as `input`.

            Raises:
                TypeError: If dtype of `mask` is not bool.
                TypeError: If `input` or `mask` is not a Tensor.
                ValueError: If the shapes of `input` and `mask` could not be broadcast.
                TypeError: If dtype of `input` or `value` is not one of bool, uint8, int8, int16, int32,
                        int64, float16, float32, float64, complex64, complex128.
                TypeError: If dtype of `value` is different from that of `input`.
                TypeError: If `value` is neither number nor Tensor.

            Supported Platforms:
                ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

            Examples:
                >>> import mindspore
                >>> import numpy as np
                >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
                >>> input = Tensor(np.array([1., 2., 3., 4.]), mindspore.float32)
                >>> mask = Tensor(np.array([True, True, False, True]), mindspore.bool_)
                >>> output = ops.masked_fill(input, mask, 0.5)
                >>> print(output)
            [0.5 0.5 3.  0.5]
