reduce_sum:
  description: |
    Reduces a dimension of a tensor by summing all elements in the dimension, by default. And also can reduce a
        dimension of `x` along the axis. Determine whether the dimensions of the output and input are the same by
        controlling `keep_dims`.
    
        Args:
            x (Tensor[Number]): The input tensor.
            axis (Union[int, tuple(int), list(int)]): The dimensions to reduce. Default: ``()`` , reduce all
                dimensions when skip_mode is ``False`` . Must be in the range [-rank(`x`), rank(`x`)).
            keep_dims (bool): If ``True`` , keep these reduced dimensions and the length is 1.
                If ``False`` , don't keep these dimensions. Default: ``False`` .
            skip_mode (bool): If ``True`` and axis is empty tuple or empty list, the ReduceSum operation isn't 
                performed, skip it. If ``True`` and axis is other values, the ReduceSum calculation is performed 
                normally. If ``False``, do reduce. Default: ``False`` .
    
        Returns:
            output(Tensor): has the same dtype as the `x`.
    
            - If axis is (), keep_dims is ``False`` , and skip_mode is ``False`` ,
              the output is a 0-D tensor representing the sum of all elements in the input tensor.
            - If axis is (), and skip_mode is ``True`` ,
              the ReduceSum operation is not performed, output tensor is equal to the input tensor.
            - If axis is int, set as 2, and keep_dims is ``False`` ,
              the shape of output is :math:`(x_1, x_3, ..., x_R)`.
            - If axis is tuple(int) or list(int), set as (2, 3), and keep_dims is ``False`` ,
              the shape of output is :math:`(x_1, x_4, ..., x_R)`.
    
        Raises:
            TypeError: If `keep_dims` is not a bool.
            TypeError: If `skip_mode` is not a bool.
            TypeError: If `x` is not a Tensor.
            ValueError: If `axis` is None.
