mul:
    description: |
        Multiplies two tensors element-wise.

            Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.mul` for more details.

            Note:
                - One of the two inputs must be a Tensor, when the two inputs have different shapes,
                  they must be able to broadcast to a common shape.
                - The two inputs can not be bool type at the same time,
                  [True, Tensor(True, bool\_), Tensor(np.array([True]), bool\_)] are all considered bool type.
                - The two inputs comply with the implicit type conversion rules to make the data types
                  consistent.

            Inputs:
                - **x** (Union[Tensor, number.Number, bool]) - The first input is a number.Number or
                  a bool or a tensor whose data type is
                  `number <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/r2.1/api_python/mindspore.html#mindspore.dtype>`_ or
                  `bool_ <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/r2.1/api_python/mindspore.html#mindspore.dtype>`_.
                - **y** (Union[Tensor, number.Number, bool]) - The second input, when the first input is a Tensor,
                  the second input should be a number.Number or bool value, or a Tensor whose data type is number or bool.
                  When the first input is Scalar, the second input must be a Tensor whose data type is number or bool.

            Outputs:
                Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting,
                and the data type is the one with higher precision or higher digits among the two inputs.

            Supported Platforms:
                ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

            Examples:
                >>> import mindspore
                >>> import numpy as np
                >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
                >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), mindspore.float32)
                >>> y = Tensor(np.array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]), mindspore.float32)
                >>> mul = ops.Mul()
                >>> output = mul(x, y)
                >>> print(output)
