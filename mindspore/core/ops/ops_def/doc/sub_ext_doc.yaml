    Subtracts scaled other value from input Tensor.
    
    .. math::
    
        out_{i} = input_{i} - alpha \times other_{i}
    
    Note:
        - When the two inputs have different shapes,
          they must be able to broadcast to a common shape.
        - The two inputs and alpha cannot be bool type at the same time,
          [True, Tensor(True, bool\_), Tensor(np.array([True]), bool\_)] are all considered bool type.
        - The two inputs and alpha comply with the implicit type conversion rules to make the data types
          consistent.
    
    Args:
        input (Union[Tensor, number.Number, bool]): The first input is a number.Number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is
            `number <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore.html#mindspore.dtype>`_ or
            `bool_ <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore.html#mindspore.dtype>`_.
        other (Union[Tensor, number.Number, bool]): The second input, is a number.Number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is
            `number <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore.html#mindspore.dtype>`_ or
            `bool_ <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore.html#mindspore.dtype>`_.
        alpha (number.Number): A scaling factor applied to `other`, default 1.
    
    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as the one of the input `input`, `other` after broadcasting,
        and the data type is the one with higher precision or higher digits among the two inputs and alpha.
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If the type of `input`, `other`, or `alpha` is not one of the following: Tensor, number.Number, bool.
        TypeError: If `alpha` is of type float but `input` and `other` are not of type float.
        TypeError: If `alpha` is of type bool but `input` and `other` are not of type bool.

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> from mindspore.ops.extend import sub
        >>> # case 1: x, y and alpha are all Tensor.
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([4, 5, 6]).astype(np.float32))
        >>> y = Tensor(np.array([1, 2, 3]).astype(np.float32))
        >>> alpha = 2.0
        >>> output = sub(x, y, alpha)
        >>> print(output)
        [2. 1. 0.]
        >>> # case 2: x is a Tensor, y is a scalar and alpha is a scalar
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([4, 5, 6]).astype(np.float32))
        >>> y = Tensor(1, mindspore.int32)
        >>> alpha = 0.5
        >>> output = sub(x, y, alpha)
        >>> print(output)
        [3.5 4.5 5.5]
        >>> # the data type of x is float32, the data type of y is int32,
        >>> # alpha is a float, and the output is the data format of higher precision float32.
        >>> print(output.dtype)
        Float32
