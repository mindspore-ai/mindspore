sub:
    description: |
        Subtracts the second input tensor from the first input tensor element-wise.

        .. math::

            out_{i} = input_{i} - other_{i}

        Note:
            - When the two inputs have different shapes, they must be able to broadcast to a common shape.
            - The two inputs can not be bool type at the same time,
              [True, Tensor(True, bool\_), Tensor(np.array([True]), bool\_)] are all considered bool type.
            - The two inputs comply with the implicit type conversion rules to make the data types
              consistent.

        Args:
            input (Union[Tensor, number.Number, bool]): The first input is a number.Number or
                a bool or a tensor whose data type is
                `number <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore.html#mindspore.dtype>`_ or
                `bool_ <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore.html#mindspore.dtype>`_.
            other (Union[Tensor, number.Number, bool]): The second input, when the first input is a Tensor,
                the second input should be a number.Number or bool value, or a Tensor whose data type is number or bool.

        Returns:
            Tensor with a shape that is the same as the broadcasted shape of the input `input` and `other`,
            and the data type is the one with higher precision or higher digits among the two inputs.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `input` and `other` are not number.Number or bool or Tensor.

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> input = Tensor(np.array([1, 2, 3]), mindspore.int32)
            >>> other = Tensor(np.array([4, 5, 6]), mindspore.int32)
            >>> output = ops.sub(input, other)
            >>> print(output)
            [-3 -3 -3]
