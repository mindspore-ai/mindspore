equal:
  description: |
    Computes the equivalence between two tensors element-wise.

    The second argument can be a number or a tensor whose shape is broadcastable with the first argument and vise versa.

    .. math::

        out_{i} =\begin{cases}
            & \text{True,    if } input_{i} = other_{i} \\
            & \text{False,   if } input_{i} \ne other_{i}
            \end{cases}

    Note:
        - `input` and `other` comply with the implicit type conversion rules to make the data types consistent.
        - The input must be two Tensors, or a Tensor and a Scalar.
        - The shapes of the inputs can be broadcasted to each other.

    Args:
        input (Union[Tensor, Number]): The first input is a number or
            a tensor whose data type is number.
        other (Union[Tensor, Number]): The second input is a number or
            a tensor whose data type is number.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting, and the data type is bool.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If neither `input` nor `other` is a Tensor or number.Number.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
        >>> # case 1: The shape of two inputs are different
        >>> input = Tensor([1, 2, 3], mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = ops.equal(input, 2.0)
        >>> print(output)
        [False True False]
        >>> # case 2: The shape of two inputs are the same
        >>> input = Tensor([1, 2, 3], mindspore.int32)
        >>> other = Tensor([1, 2, 4], mindspore.int32)
        >>> output = ops.equal(input, other)
        >>> print(output)
        [ True  True False]
