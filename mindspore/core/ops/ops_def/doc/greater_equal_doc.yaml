greater_equal:
    description: |
        Given two Tensors, compares them element-wise to check if each element in the first
        Tensor is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in the second Tensor.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.ge` for more details.

        Args:
            input (Union[Tensor, Number]): The first input is a number or
                a bool or a tensor whose data type is number or bool.
            other (Union[Tensor, Number]): When the first input is a Tensor, the second input should be a Number or Tensor with data type number or bool.
                When the first input is a Scalar, the second input must be a Tensor with data type number or bool.

        Returns:
            Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting, and the data type is bool.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> input = Tensor(np.array([1, 2, 3]), mindspore.int32)
            >>> other = Tensor(np.array([1, 1, 4]), mindspore.int32)
            >>> output = ops.greater_equal(input, other)
            >>> print(output)
            [True True False]
