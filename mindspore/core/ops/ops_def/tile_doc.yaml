        Replicates an input tensor with given multiples times.

        Creates a new tensor by replicating `input` `multiples` times. The i'th dimension of
        output tensor has `input.shape[i] * multiples[i]` elements, and the values of `input`
        are replicated `multiples[i]` times along the i'th dimension.

        Note:
            The length of `multiples` must be greater or equal to the length of dimension in `input`.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): 1-D or higher dimensional Tensor. Set the shape of input tensor as
                :math:`(x_1, x_2, ..., x_S)` .

            multiples (tuple[int]): The parameter that specifies the number of replications,
                the parameter type is tuple, and the data type is int, i.e., :math:`(y_1, y_2, ..., y_S)`.
                The length of `multiples` cannot be smaller than the length of the shape of `input`.
                Only constant value is allowed.

        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same data type as the `input`. Suppose the length of `multiples` is `d`,
            the dimension of `input` is `input.dim`, and the shape of `input` is :math:`(x_1, x_2, ..., x_S)`.

            - If `input.dim = d`, then the shape of their corresponding positions can be multiplied, and
            the shape of Outputs is :math:`(x_1*y_1, x_2*y_2, ..., x_S*y_S)`.
            - If `input.dim < d`, fill in multiple 1 in the length of the shape of `input` until their
            lengths are consistent. Such as set the shape of `input` as :math:`(1, ..., x_1, x_2, ..., x_S)`,
            then the shape of their corresponding positions can be multiplied, and the shape of Outputs is
            :math:`(1*y_1, ..., x_R*y_R, x_S*y_S)`.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `multiples` is not a tuple or its elements are not all int.
            ValueError: If the elements of `multiples` are not all greater than 0.
            ValueError: If the length of `multiples` are smaller than the length of dimension in `input`.
