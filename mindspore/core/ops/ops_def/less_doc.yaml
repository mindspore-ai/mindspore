less:
  description: |
    Computes the boolean value of :math:`x < y` element-wise.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.less` for more details.

        Inputs:
            - **x** (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]) -  The first input is a number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is number or bool.
            - **y** (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]) - The second input is a number or
            a bool when the first input is a tensor, or it can be a tensor whose data type is number or bool.

        Outputs:
            Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting,and the data type is bool.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1, 2, 3]), mindspore.int32)
            >>> y = Tensor(np.array([1, 1, 4]), mindspore.int32)
            >>> output = ops.less(x, y)
            >>> print(output)
            [False False True]
