reshape:
    description: |
        Rearranges the input Tensor based on the given shape.

            The 'shape' can only have one -1 at most, in which case it's inferred from the remaining dimensions and
            the number of elements in the input.
        
            Args:
                input (Tensor): The shape of tensor is :math:`(x_1, x_2, ..., x_R)`.
                shape (Union[tuple[int], Tensor[int]]): Constructed by multiple
                    integers, i.e., :math:`(y_1, y_2, ..., y_S)`. Only constant value is allowed.
        
            Returns:
                Tensor, the shape of tensor is :math:`(y_1, y_2, ..., y_S)`.
        
            Raises:
                ValueError: Given a shape tuple, if it has several -1; or if the product
                    of its elements is less than or equal to 0 or cannot be divided by the product
                    of the input tensor shape; or if it does not match the input's array size.

            Examples:
                >>> import mindspore
                >>> import numpy as np
                >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
                >>> input = Tensor(np.array([[-0.1, 0.3, 3.6], [0.4, 0.5, -3.2]]), mindspore.float32)
                >>> output = ops.reshape(input, (3, 2))
                >>> print(output)
                [[-0.1  0.3]
                 [ 3.6  0.4]
                 [ 0.5 -3.2]]
