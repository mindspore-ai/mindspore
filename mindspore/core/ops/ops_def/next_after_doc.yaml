        Returns the next representable floating-point value after `input` towards `other` element-wise.
    
            Say there are two float32 numbers :math:`a`, :math:`b`, and let the
            representable delta of float32 datatype is :math:`eps`. If :math:`a < b`,
            then the next representable of :math:`a` towards :math:`b` is :math:`a+eps`,
            the next representable of :math:`b` towards :math:`a` is :math:`b-eps`.
        
            .. math::

            out_{i} =  nextafter({input_{i}, other_{i}})
        
            Args:
                input (Tensor): The first input tensor. The shape of tensor is :math:`(N,*)` where :math:`*` means,
                    any number of additional dimensions. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64.
        
                other (Tensor): The second input tensor. The shape of tensor is :math:`(N,*)` where :math:`*` means,
                    any number of additional dimensions. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64.
        
            Returns:
                Tensor, it has the same shape as the `x` and `y` after broadcasting.
        
            Raises:
                TypeError: If neither `input` nor `other` is a Tensor.
                TypeError: If the dtype of `input` and `other` is not one of: float32, float64.
                TypeError: If the dtypes of `input` and `other` are not same.
                ValueError: If `input`'s shape is not the same as `other`.
