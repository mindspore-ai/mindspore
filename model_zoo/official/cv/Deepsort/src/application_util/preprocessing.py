def non_max_suppression(boxes, max_bbox_overlap, scores=None):
    """Suppress overlapping detections.

    Original code from [1]_ has been adapted to include confidence score.

    .. [1] http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/02/16/
           faster-non-maximum-suppression-python/

    Examples
    --------

        >>> boxes = [d.roi for d in detections]
        >>> scores = [d.confidence for d in detections]
        >>> indices = non_max_suppression(boxes, max_bbox_overlap, scores)
        >>> detections = [detections[i] for i in indices]

    Parameters
    ----------
    boxes : ndarray
        Array of ROIs (x, y, width, height).
    max_bbox_overlap : float
        ROIs that overlap more than this values are suppressed.
    scores : Optional[array_like]
        Detector confidence score.

    Returns
    -------
    List[int]
        Returns indices of detections that have survived non-maxima suppression.
